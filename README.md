# Digital Image Processing Mini Projects

This repository contains 5 jupyter notebooks each containing necessary functions implementing Digital Image Processing course projects.


Phases:
1. Registering images on a cube (transformation_and_registration.ipynb)
2. Sharpening and blurring in spatial domain (filters.ipynb)
3. Phase 2, but in frequency domain (freq_proc.ipynb)
4. Working with histograms and using them for image enhancement (histogram.ipynb)
5. Copy-Move detection and noise reduction using wavelets (wavelet_proc.ipynb)

All implementations are based on what I've learned from [Digital Image Processing, 3rd edition Book by Rafael C. GONZALES and Richard E. Woods](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/196018.Digital_Image_Processing)
